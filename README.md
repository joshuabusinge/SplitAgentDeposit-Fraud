# Machine Learning Approach For Split-Agent Deposit Fraud Detection In Mobile Money Transactions
Machine learning approach for split agent deposit fraud detection in mobile money transactions. 
Split-agent deposit - in mobile money transactions is made when an agent persuades clients
to divide the transaction value of cash into small amounts so that the agent can generate
more income. Split-agent deposit is more common in flat rate and staggered commission
models. 
As discussed in the scenario below.
_Peter wants to deposit 100,000 Ugandan shillings into his account. The agent will receive
2,000 Ugandan shillings if the deposit is made. The agent divides the funds into ten portions
of 10,000 Uganda shillings so as to increase his/her profits. Each deposit earns 500 Uganda
shillings, bringing their combined commission to 5,000 Uganda shillings, which is a signifi-
cant increase above 2,000 Uganda shillings if the deposit were made in one single payment.
Customers are not disadvantaged under this system because they do not pay fees on deposits._
